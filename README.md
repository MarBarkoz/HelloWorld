# HelloWorld
EDx

I'm completely new to the coding world. I've dabbled with some quick free bootcamps for Skillcrush and Codecademy, and have now started taking the EDx CS50 class. I hope to be able to wrap my brain around the language, logic and precision of it all, and hopefully start a new career. 

I also need to learn to drive. 

Wish me luck!
